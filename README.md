# [Bunny Engine](http://www.bunnyagents.com/engine) 

Bunny Engine is the Titanium application code that powers [Dust Bunnies: Secret Agents] (http://www.bunnyagents.com/) on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.  

Bunny Engine should allow anyone with an idea for a profile-driven narrated storybook and some JavaScript experience to create a simple, easy to use iPhone and iPad application.  Oh, and you'll need some art.  A whole lot of art.

For an example of how the app works, check out the demos of [Dust Bunnies: Secret Agents](http://www.bunnyagents.com), or pick it up from the app store.  

We're also releasing the graphics for the story in 1024x768 PSDs under a Creative Commons license.  They live at [https://github.com/jeffk/bunny-agents-art](https://github.com/jeffk/bunny-agents-art).

## Quickstart

You'll need the [iOS SDK](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action), xCode, and [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-platform/) installed to use Bunny Engine.  Once it's all running, create a new project and check this repository out into the project's resources directory.  You should then be able to fire up the code in the Titanium/xCode Simulator.

## Limitations

The application has not been updated with retina ready art or 16x9 layout options for the iPhone 5.  It has been tested under iOS 6, and works fine.

## Developers

It was developed for [Polycot Labs, LLC](http://www.polycotlabs.com/), by a team organized by [Jeff Kramer](http://www.jeffkramer.com/), consisting of [Daniel Tamas] (https://twitter.com/dan_tamas), an independent mobile developer and [Alpesh Patel] (https://twitter.com/alpesh_harsoda) of [Logistic Infotech] (http://logisticinfotech.com/).
